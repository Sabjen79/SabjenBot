# SabjenBot
 SabjenBot is an annoying Discord Bot that can play music (even on its own) and initiate conversations (usually to annoy people), written in Java using [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) and [LavaPlayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer).

Features
 - Play music through a voice channel. When the bot plays a song, it has a chance to make it unskippable. It can even play music on its own and have preferences, based on what songs are queued by other people.
 - It can initiate conversations when a user joins/leaves a voice channel, when it is mentioned in a message from a server or private channel and even do random announcements.
 - It will randomly change its profile photo from a folder.
 - It automatically joins voice channels (to annoy everyone)
 - It offers a simple (yet buggy) UI for convenience.
 - WIP!!!
